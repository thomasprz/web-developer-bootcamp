        The <b>chicken</b> is a domesticated subspecies of the red
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a>,
        originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around
        8,000 years ago and is now one of the most common and widespread
        domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their
        meat and eggs, though they are also kept as pets.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with
        more than 50 billion birds produced annually for consumption.
        Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed
        for meat and egg production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can
        produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social animals with complex
        vocalizations and behaviors, and feature prominently in folklore,
        religion, and literature across many societies. Their economic
        importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry and
        agriculture.

        <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
        <p>
          Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the
          word chicken, as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff
          laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam". The usage
          is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands. In
          older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts,
          chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.

        <p>
          Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called
          a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under
          their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in
          males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under
          the face, giving the appearance of a beard.
